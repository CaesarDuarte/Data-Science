# Diabetes Prediction Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I undertake a comprehensive analysis of health and demographic data to predict diabetes risk. Leveraging a dataset of 100,000 individuals, I employ advanced data science and machine learning techniques to identify key factors contributing to diabetes and develop a robust predictive model. This project showcases my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, as I work to uncover valuable insights that could potentially impact diabetes prevention and management strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- Gender, age, and location
- Race (African American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, Other)
- Health indicators (hypertension, heart disease, smoking history)
- BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level
- Diabetes status

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and modeling
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Development and Evaluation
5. Insights and Conclusions

## Key Findings
(To be updated as the project progresses)

## Future Work
(Potential areas for expansion or improvement)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks
